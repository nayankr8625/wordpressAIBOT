# RAG-Based Query Suggestion Chatbot with Chain of Thought for WordPress Sites

## Overview
This project involves developing a sophisticated chatbot system designed to function across various WordPress blogs and websites. The chatbot integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology and employs a Chain of Thought (CoT) strategy to provide a seamless, contextually aware interaction experience.

## Key Features
- **Versatility**: The chatbot adapts its interaction style and content based on the specific WordPress site where it is deployed.
- **Chain of Thought**: A structured logical flow enhances the chatbot's responses, improving context continuity and user experience.
- **Dynamic Responses**: Responses are generated in real-time, with the ability to retrieve relevant information from the WordPress site.
- **Scalability**: The system architecture supports scaling to accommodate different site sizes and user demands.

## System Design

### Requirement Analysis
To ensure the chatbot's versatility and relevance, a comprehensive analysis of typical user queries and interactions across a variety of WordPress blogs was conducted. This analysis informs the chatbot's ability to:
- Understand and adapt to various topics and contexts.
- Guide users through a logical series of questions to resolve queries.
- Maintain a high level of context continuity and relevance in responses.

### Architecture Design
The architecture is designed for scalability, real-time data retrieval, efficient processing, and dynamic response generation. The following components make up the chatbot system:

- **Data Retrieval**: Utilizes WordPress APIs to fetch content updates in real-time. This ensures that the chatbot's responses are always based on the latest information available on the site.
- **Embedding Generator**: Converts textual content into vector embeddings using advanced models like Sentence-BERT. This allows for efficient semantic similarity calculations and content retrieval.
- **Vector Database**: Employs a system like Faiss to store and retrieve embeddings efficiently. This component is crucial for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation process.
- **RAG Processor**: The core component that integrates the RAG system to generate responses based on retrieved information from the WordPress site.
- **Chain of Thought Module**: Enhances the RAG outputs with a logical progression of thought, improving the chatbot's ability to maintain context and deliver coherent responses.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly chat interface designed for WordPress integration. This interface can dynamically display the chatbot's thought process, providing users with a transparent view of how responses are generated.

### Deployment and Integration
The chatbot is designed for easy integration into existing WordPress sites. Key aspects of deployment include:
- WordPress plugin development for seamless installation and activation.
- Customization options to adapt the chatbot's style and behavior to match the site's branding and tone.
- Integration with other WordPress plugins and systems to ensure compatibility and a smooth user experience.

## Usage and Interaction
Once integrated into a WordPress site, the chatbot can be accessed through a chat widget or a dedicated section on the website. Users can interact with the chatbot by typing their questions or queries. The chatbot's Chain of Thought strategy guides users through a logical series of questions to arrive at accurate and contextually relevant responses.
